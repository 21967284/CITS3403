# A Journey Through the TCP/IP Model
**A journey through the TCP/IP Model** is an educational app designed to help IT students understand the TCP/IP model of networking. 

It explains the layers of the TCP/IP Model through the perspective of a byte of information trying to make its way from the application layer down to the data layer.

To ensure understanding, there is a small quiz after each section. 

To help motivate students to complete the entire module, there is a progress and results page that shows their current stats.
