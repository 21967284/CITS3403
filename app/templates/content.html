                The link layer is the lowest layer in the Internet Protocol Suite (IP) suite. What this means is that
                this layer is the layer closest to the physical hardware.

                You may not have given much thought to how a computer is able to do all the things its able to do based
                on just electricity and voltage - but there is actually a lot that needs to happen.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this layer, we'll explore what those things are.

                                    As you may recall, a byte is several bits put together. And a bit is just a piece of
                                    information representing either 0 or 1, true or false, on or off.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    How might we use electricity to represent this information?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Well, it's actually pretty simple. We can turn on the electricity to represent
                                    on/true/1 and we can turn off the electricity to represent off/false/0.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We put several of these on and off signals together and bam! We have a byte!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That's how I, the great mighty, <code>[byte name]</code> came about!
